There are 2 issues:

1. Some images have cells in that very small part touches the boundary so should we have to consider it as partial cell 
   or not. There are some edge detection algorithm from which we can find out whether it is a partial cell or not because
   if edge pixel touches the boundary then it is cell otherwise not. Some opencv algorithm removes the border touching object too
   if we don't remove partial cell then it becomes easy, not complex 

2. if a cell contains starch then starch cell should be having both lables cell lable and starch label.

Steps to Connect with GPU:

A. https://lepim.jio.com/PasswordVault/v10/logon/ldap
B. Login with username and password after getting the access
C. Search the IP: 10.144.114.210
D. Connect and rdp will be downloaded and open it
E. Click on "No" for a dialogue box
F. Make your own folder with your name
G. create python virtual environment in that folder
H. Access the jupyter notebook using the command: jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --allow-root
I. It will show 2 links. copy the 2nd like with 127.0.0.1/.. and paste it in your local browser and change the ip 127.0.0.1 to server ip
   10.144.114.210 and then you will access it.

(To check the cuda version for gpu: run in terminal: nvidia-smi and also nvcc --version)

* Create a virtual environment as:

A. go to your project directory in terminal
B. python -m venv myenv
C. source myenv/bin/activate

* export proxies:

export http_proxy=http://lwproxy.jio.com:8080/
export https_proxy=https://lwproxy.jio.com:8080/

* install python packages

pip install -r requirements.txt


* to upload a directory from local to server. Use upload option of notebook but first convert it into a zip file then upload
