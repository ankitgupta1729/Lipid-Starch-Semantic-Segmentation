There are 2 issues:

1. Some images have cells in that very small part touches the boundary so should we have to consider it as partial cell 
   or not. There are some edge detection algorithm from which we can find out whether it is a partial cell or not because
   if edge pixel touches the boundary then it is cell otherwise not. Some opencv algorithm removes the border touching object too
   if we don't remove partial cell then it becomes easy, not complex 

2. if a cell contains starch then starch cell should be having both lables cell lable and starch label.
